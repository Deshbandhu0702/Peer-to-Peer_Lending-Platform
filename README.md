# Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform

## 📌 Project Title
**Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform**

## 📝 Project Description
A decentralized smart contract-based application built using the Soroban SDK on Stellar, enabling users to lend and borrow funds directly without the need for a traditional banking intermediary.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To democratize lending and borrowing by providing a transparent, secure, and accessible peer-to-peer platform powered by smart contracts on a decentralized ledger.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Loan Offering**: Any user can offer a loan to another user by specifying a borrower and an amount.
- **Repayment Functionality**: Borrowers can repay their loans once they’ve received them.
- **Loan Status Tracking**: Loans can be individually queried for status, lender/borrower identity, and repayment status.
- **Immutable Records**: Loan history is stored immutably on-chain, ensuring transparency and security.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- **Collateralized Lending**: Introduce support for collateral to minimize default risk.
- **Interest Rates**: Add logic to apply and track interest on loan amounts.
- **Reputation System**: Implement a decentralized credit score mechanism.
- **Dispute Resolution**: On-chain dispute handling between lenders and borrowers.
- **Token Support**: Integrate multi-token lending via Soroban’s token interface.
